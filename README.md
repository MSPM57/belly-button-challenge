# belly-button-challenge

The challenge  here is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset.
This is to be accomplished using The D3 libary to read in samples.json from the url:
https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

A horizontal barchart as well as a bubble chart will refresh when selecting  Test Subject ID which will propagate the
Demongraphic Information and then be used to update the plots.

I also did the extra credit for the Gauge using 10 values.

please see live screen appearance.jpg

My page looks like this as well and is interactive when you changes test subject id's.
see Bellybutton Biodiversity.html file which captures my screen.

The outcome is to show how much microbial species were in test subject's belly button using the operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, from the study.

It was a difficult subject to think about!
